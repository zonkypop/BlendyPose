## Note
This will install to Blender's Python path, rather than your system's.

## Install
1 - Open Blender

2 - Go to Edit > Preferences > Add Ons > Install Add on, then select blendy_pose.py and click enable

3 - Open the BlendyPose panel and click Start Camera! The first time will take around a minute to install the libraries

BlendyPose is made using [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe), [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python)

[Nicholas Renotte](https://www.youtube.com/c/NicholasRenotte) provided some Mediapipe knowledge.

weixin_44834086 demonstrated how to downgrade protobuf, which makes mediapipe compatible with Blender 3 and up!
